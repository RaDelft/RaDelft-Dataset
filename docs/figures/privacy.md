## 2. Where is my data derived from and which data is processed?
In accordance with the data protection principles, personal data (“data”) is only to be processed to the extent the data is required and allowed due to applicable legal requirements or due to legal obligations. Unless otherwise specified by the following, the terms “process” and “processing” comprise particularly the collection, the usage, storage, disclosure and transfer of personal data (see Article 4 Nr. 2 of the EU Data Protection Regulation).
We process data recorded from a vehicle driven through Delft, the Netherlands, as described in the publication: See Further than CFAR: A Data-Driven Radar Detector Trained by Lidar, (available from https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12970). This data is derived from various sensors aboard the vehicle: video, radar, LiDAR, GNSS/INS and proprioceptive vehicle sensors. It furthermore consists of human annotations added in a post-process (e.g. the location of road users in sensor data and with respect to the recording vehicle). This data is referred to as sensor-related RaDelft data in the remainder. The sensor-related RaDelft data does not contain identified individuals (names, addresses, or similar) but it does contain identifiable individuals as far as image data is concerned showing identifiable faces and license plates.
Furthermore, we process data such as full name, affiliation, email address, affiliation, meta-data, analytical, diagnostic and technical data, and usage statistics concerning or arising from your use of the RaDelft Dataset. This data is referred to as administration-related RaDelft data in the remainder.
Sensor-related and administration-related RaDelft data is jointly referred to as RaDelft data or RaDelft dataset in the remainder.
 
## 3. What is my data used for (purpose of processing) and what is the legal basis?
The sensor-related RaDelft data was collected and is processed in order to perform and facilitate research in the area of environment perception for self-driving vehicles, mobile robotics and intelligent transportation systems. Specifically, the purpose is to advance the development of methods for
•	establishing the spatiotemporal structure of the traffic environment,
•	detecting the various road users (e.g. pedestrians, cyclists, mopeds, motorcycles, cars, busses, trucks) and elements of the traffic infrastructure (e.g. lanes, road markings, lights, signs, poles),
•	extracting attribute information that is indicative of how a traffic situation will evolve (e.g. phase of traffic light, the pose of a pedestrian), and
•	traffic situation assessment, in particular estimating collision risk
using the vehicle-based sensors and possible prior knowledge (e.g. map information). As part of this research, no individual in the traffic scene shall be identified (by name, address, or similar).
It should be noted that typical privacy enhancing (anonymization) measures such as blurring or masking of the relevant image regions are not feasible, as it would introduce a bias in the image data, which would unduly and negatively affect the performance of machine learning methods used in the purpose of processing, when faced with the case of observing a real physical scene, where such image bias would not be present.
The legal basis for sensor-related RaDelft data processing is to perform a research task in the legitimate interest of the Delft University of Technology: to advance science and technology, especially with respect to safety, comfort and efficiency of transportation.
The administration-related RaDelft data is collected in order to provide the functionality of and improvement of the RaDelft Dataset, for product development and marketing purposes, to protect against spam and malware, and for verifying License compliance. The legal basis for administration-related RaDelft data processing is provided by user consent.
 
## 4. Is my data forwarded?
The sensor-related RaDelft data is made available to qualified researchers at established academic and non-profit scientific organizations for non-commercial, research use (e.g. benchmarking). The permission to access and process the data is made contingent on, among others, adherence to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as specified in a license agreement whose signing is required prior to the use of the sensor-related RaDelft dataset.
The administration-related RaDelft data is not forwarded to other parties and remains with the Delft University of Technology; it is also governed by the EU GDPR.
  
## 5. How long are my data stored?
The Dutch Code of Conduct for Academic Practice requires that all research data are stored for at least ten years.
The sensor-related RaDelft data is stored for an initial period of ten years at Delft University of Technology. After this initial period, an assessment will be made whether the sensor-related RaDelft data is still being useful for the before-mentioned purpose of processing. The usefulness will be assessed by the number of publications that cite the RaDelft dataset and/or by the number of submissions to the RaDelft evaluation server. In case the assessment shows the RaDelft data is still useful for the before-mentioned purpose of processing, the storage period will be extended by another ten years, at point which the usefulness assessment and extension cycle can be repeated. In case the assessment shows that RaDelft data is not useful anymore for the before-mentioned purpose of processing, all outstanding licenses will immediately be terminated, and the RaDelft dataset will be deleted from storage at Delft University of Technology.
The personal data of a certain user in the administration-related RaDelft data is stored for a maximum of ten years, or until the user revokes consent by contacting the entity responsible for the processing of personal RaDelft data (see section1), whatever time period is shorter.
 
## 6. How is my data stored?
The RaDelft Dataset is stored on webservers of the Delft University of Technology. Appropriate measures for physical and electronical (e.g. password protection, encryption) access control for the RaDelft Dataset have been implemented.
 
## 7. What rights do I have vis-à-vis Delft University of Technology?
With respect to your personal data you have following rights to claim:
•	Right on information: You have the right on information on your stored data with us, especially for what purpose, and how long the data is stored (Article 15 GDPR).
•	Right to correct incorrect data: You have the right to ask for immediate correction of your incorrectly stored personal data (Article 16 GDPR).
•	Right to delete: You have the right to ask for the deletion of your personal data. These requirements foresee that you may ask for deletion of your personal data in case we do not need the data anymore for the purpose the data has been collected or processed in the first place. You may also ask for deletion in case we have processed your data unlawfully or in case you have legitimately contradicted to the storage and process of your data or in case there is a legal obligation for the deletion of your data (Article 17 GDPR).
•	Right to restrict processing: You have the right to ask for a restriction on the processing of your data. This right is particularly valid for the duration of the assessment in case of your claimed doubt of the correctness of your data and in case you wish a restricted processing of your data when you have the right on deletion of your data. Furthermore, a restriction of the processing of your data takes place, although the data is no longer required for the pursued purposes, in the case that you require the data to assert, exercise or defend legal rights as well as when the successful exercise of objection between you and us is in dispute (Article 18 GDPR).
